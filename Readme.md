# Overview
<br>

- This project is done in the light of a learning process dedicated to understanding how aerial vehicules work and "think" .

- All thanks go to Mr Joop Brokking , through his well commented and easy to understand code and schematics , i was able to solve all 
problems from start to finish in relatively no time . Going through multiple version of the flight controller ( Arduino , STM32 ) it was possible to add amazing features like GPS hold and RTH (return to home) and much more . Despite the challenges , Building the whole thing was actually fun , the most challenging part was flying it , and i have to admit my flying skills need working on ...

- At the end of this project i gained some knowledge on techniques , components and modules involved in a flight controller and ultimately a stable Quadcopter , notably :
    
    - Antennas
    - Propellers
    - Electronic Speed Controllers
    - Lipo batteries 
    - RC receivers
    - Motors
    - PID controllers
    - Registers 
    - I2C protocol 
    - Timers
    - Interrupts 
    - STM32F103C8T6
    - MPU6050 (gyroscope + accelerometer)
    - IMU (inertial measurement unit)
    - MNEA GPS protocol 
    - M8N GPS module 
    - Telemetry
    - Bitwise operators 
    - MS5611 (barometer)
    - ...
